*   when run directly the driver now distinguishes between no sensor ID
    response and an empty sensor ID response
*   reworked battery state, signal level and sensor ID processing to cater for
    changes to battery state reporting introduced in GW1000 API v1.6.0 (GW1000
    v1.6.5 firmware)
*   The GW1000 cumulative daily lightning count field is now included in driver
    loop packets as field 'lightningcount' (the default field name). Previously
